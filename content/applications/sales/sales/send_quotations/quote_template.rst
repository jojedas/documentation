Quotation templates
===================

Use quotation templates to speed up the quotation creation process.

Configuration
=============

Go to :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Settings` and enable :guilabel:`Quotation
Templates`.

Create a template
=================

Go to :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Quotations Templates` and click :guilabel:`New`.

.. note::
   Apart from the name, all template fields are optional.

After having named the template, choose default values for the following fields:

- :guilabel:`Quotation expires after`: choose the number of days for which the quotation is valid.
- :guilabel:`Online confirmation`: after sending the quotation by email, choose if the customer
  should confirm it online on their portal:

  - by providing a :guilabel:`Signature`,
  - by making a :guilabel:`Payment`,
  - or both.

- :guilabel:`Confirmation Mail`: send an email to the customer upon confirming the quotation by
  selecting an email template.

On the :guilabel:`Lines` tab, add the default products and their quantity. Add any
:guilabel:`Optional Products` on the homonymous tab.

Finally, add any specific sales terms and conditions on the :guilabel:`Terms & Conditions` tab.

.. tip::
   If the terms and conditions are standard across all quotations, :doc:`set them globally in the
   Accounting/Invoicing settings
   <../../../finance/accounting/receivables/customer_invoices/terms_conditions>` instead.

Design a template
=================

Customize the appearance of quotations on the customer portal by going to :menuselection:`Sales -->
Configuration --> Settings` and enabling the :guilabel:`Quotation Builder` feature.

.. note::
   If necessary, Odoo automatically installs the Website app when enabling this feature.

Select a template by going to :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Quotations Templates` and
clicking :guilabel:`Design Template`. On the Website Builder, click :guilabel:`Edit`. Drag and drop
the building blocks, edit the content, and :guilabel:`Save`.

fields are then filled accordingly. Manually edit any pre-filled field if needed.

   Go to :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Settings` to select a :guilabel:`Default
   Template`.
