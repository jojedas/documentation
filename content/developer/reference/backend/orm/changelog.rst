Changelog
=========

Odoo Online version 16.4
========================

- `odoo.models.Model.name_get` has been deprecated with
  TODO. Instead read display_name.

Odoo Online version 16.3
========================

- `odoo.models.Model._read_group` has a new signature with
  `#110737 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/110737>`_

Odoo Online version 16.2
========================

- Refactor the implementation of searching and reading methods to be able to
  combine both in a minimal number of SQL queries. We introduce two new methods
  `odoo.models.Model.search_fetch` and `odoo.models.Model.fetch` that take
  advantage of the combination. More details can be found on the pull request
  `#112126 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/112126>`_.

Odoo version 16.0
=================

- Translations for translated fields are stored as JSONB values with
  `#97692 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/97692>`_
  and `#101115 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/101115>`_.
  Code translations are no longer stored into the database.
  They become static and are extracted from the PO files when needed.

Odoo Online version 15.4
========================

- New API for flushing to the database and invalidating the cache with
  `#87527 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/87527>`_.
  New methods have been added to `odoo.models.Model` and `odoo.api.Environment`,
  and are less confusing about what is actually done in each case.
  See the section :ref:`SQL Execution <reference/orm/sql>`.

Odoo Online version 15.2
========================

- Specific index types on fields:  With `#83274 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83274>`_ and
  `#83015 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/83015>`_, developers can now define what type of
  indexes can be used on fields by PostgreSQL. See the :ref:`index property <reference/fields>` of
  `odoo.fields.Field`.
